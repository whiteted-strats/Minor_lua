# Metadata watch

This takes a table of metadata (from another lua script) and provides a form which takes addresses as inputs and generates a watch file for bizhawk.

metadata_watch_generator.lua is the main lua script, which imports metadata_spec.lua (make sure it is in the same directory / the lua library as appropriate).
metadata_spec.lua is where you should define the metadata table and if desired the size
metadata.wch is an example file generated by the script
